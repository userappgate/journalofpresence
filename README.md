Journal of Presence
===================

This script creates a journal of presence for the current month, asks
the absence dates and creates a pdf file.

Then it signs the pdf file with gpg and sends it on slack.

It's all hardcoded for myself, feel free to adapt.

Requirements
------------

* python3.8
* chromium
* gpg
* localslackirc
